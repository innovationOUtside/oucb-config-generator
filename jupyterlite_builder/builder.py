# Build a JupyterLite distribution from an oucb template

# Apt packages
# - can these be replaced by wasm packages?
# - if not, thiese cannot be installed.

# Py packages:
# Are these available:
# - in pyodide?
# - as `none-any` wheels?
# - in Emscripten-forge? https://beta.mamba.pm/channels/emscripten-forge

# If packages are in pyodide or `none-any` wheels, we should be able to use pyodide kernel. (Maybe need an option to set kernel)
